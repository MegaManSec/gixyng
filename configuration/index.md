# Configuration

You can run `gixy` entirely from CLI flags, but a configuration file may also be used to read settings, including output formatting, where to write reports, which checks to run, whether to process `include` directives, some plugin-specific settings, output severity filtering, and where to look for custom variable drop-ins.

If you are looking for day-to-day CLI usage examples, see the [Usage Guide](https://gixy.io/usage/).

## Where config files live

By default, `gixy` looks in these locations (loaded in this order):

- `/etc/gixy/gixy.cfg`
- `~/.config/gixy/gixy.conf`

You can also point to a specific file:

```
# Load gixy configuration file from ./gixy.conf
gixy --config ./gixy.conf
```

And if you want a starting point, you can generate a config file from your current command-line args:

```
# Write a gixy configuration file to ./gixy.conf
gixy --write-config ./gixy.conf
```

## File format

The format is intentionally boring:

- `key = value`
- `#` starts a comment
- optional `[sections]` (mainly used for plugin settings)

Values may be quoted or not, and lists should be comma-separated.

Most keys match the long CLI flags with the leading `--` removed. For example:

- CLI: `--disable-includes`
- Config: `disable-includes = true`

`[sections]` blocks are equivalent to their appended, CLI flag usage. For example, the config equivalent of `--add-header-redefinition-headers X-Frame-Options` is:

```
[add_header_redefinition]
headers = X-Frame-Options
```

For non-plugin options, use the `[gixy]` block:

```
[gixy]
level = 2
```

## Settings you can configure

These are the knobs you can set in the config file.

### level

You may set the level of filtering applied to the output of `gixy`:

```
; Report issues of a given severity level or higher (-l for LOW, -ll for MEDIUM, -lll for HIGH)
level = 2
```

### format

Choose the output format:

```
format = console   # default, colored output
# format = text    # plain text (no ANSI)
# format = json    # machine-readable JSON
```

### output

Write results to a file instead of stdout:

```
output = ./gixy-report.json
```

### debug

Run `gixy` in debug mode or not:

```
; Turn on debug mode
debug = false
```

### tests

You may wish to only run a specific set of tests:

```
; Comma-separated list of tests to exclusively run
tests = add_header_redefinition,hash_without_default,http_splitting
```

## skips

You may wish to skip specific tests:

```
; Comma-separated list of tests to exclusively skip
skips = proxy_pass_normalized,if_is_evil
```

### disable-includes

If enabled, `include` directives do not have their included-files read:

```
; Disable "include" directive processing
disable-includes = false
```

### vars-dirs

Provide directories containing custom variable drop-ins:

```
; Comma-separated list of directories with custom variable drop-ins
vars-dirs = ./vars,/etc/gixy/vars
```

If you do not know what vars-dirs is, you probably do not need it. When you do, the dedicated guide is in [Custom Variables & Drop-Ins](https://gixy.io/variables-dropins/).

## Minimal example

A tiny config that skips the `low_keepalive_requests` test, and saves a JSON-formatted report to `gixy-report.json`.

```
[gixy]
format = json
output = ./gixy-report.json
skips = low_keepalive_requests
```

Run it like this:

```
# Load gixy configuration file from ./gixy.conf
gixy --config ./gixy.conf
```

## Plugin-specific flags

Most `gixy` settings are global and work well as shared defaults in a config file. Some plugins also expose their own flags (and those can be set via CLI or via the config file), but the details are specific to each check.

If you need to tune a specific plugin, start with its documentation:

- [add_header_redefinition](https://gixy.io/plugins/add_header_redefinition/)
- [origins](https://gixy.io/plugins/origins/)
- [regex_redos](https://gixy.io/plugins/regex_redos/)
