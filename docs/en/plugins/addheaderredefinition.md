# [add_header_redefinition] Redefining of response headers by  "add_header" directive

Unfortunately, many people don't know how the inheritance of directives works. Most often this leads to misuse of the `add_header` directive while trying to add a new response header on the nested level.
This feature is mentioned in Nginx [docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_headers_module.html#add_header):
> There could be several `add_header` directives. These directives are inherited from the previous level if and only if there are no `add_header` directives defined on the current level.

The logic is quite simple: if you set headers at one level (for example, in `server` section) and then at a lower level (let's say `location`) you set some other headers, then the first headers will be discarded.

It's easy to check:
  - Configuration:
```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
  location / {
      return 200 "index";
  }

  location /new-headers {
    # Add special cache control
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate" always;
    add_header Pragma "no-cache" always;

    return 200 "new-headers";
  }
}
```
  - Request to location `/` (`X-Frame-Options` header is in server response):
```http
GET / HTTP/1.0

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.10.2
Date: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 19:28:33 GMT
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 5
Connection: close
X-Frame-Options: DENY

index
```
  - Request to location `/new-headers` (headers `Cache-Control` and `Pragma` are present, but there's no `X-Frame-Options`):
```http
GET /new-headers HTTP/1.0


HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.10.2
Date: Mon, 09 Jan 2017 19:29:46 GMT
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 11
Connection: close
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache

new-headers
```

## What can I do?
There are several ways to solve this problem:

### 1. Use `add_header_inherit` (nginx 1.29.3+)

Starting with nginx 1.29.3, you can use the `add_header_inherit` directive to inherit headers from parent levels:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
    
    location /new-headers {
        add_header_inherit on;  # Inherit X-Frame-Options from server
        add_header Cache-Control "no-cache" always;
        return 200 "new-headers";
    }
}
```

This is the cleanest solution if you're running nginx 1.29.3 or later.

### 2. Duplicate important headers

Manually include all parent headers in nested locations:

```nginx
location /new-headers {
    add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;  # Duplicated
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache" always;
    return 200 "new-headers";
}
```

### 3. Set all headers at one level

Set all headers in the `server` section and avoid `add_header` in locations.

### 4. Use ngx_headers_more module

Use [ngx_headers_more](https://nginx-extras.getpagespeed.com/modules/headers-more/) module which has better inheritance behavior.

### CLI and config options

- `--add-header-redefinition-headers headers` (Default: unset): Comma-separated, case-insensitive allowlist of headers to report when dropped. When unset, all dropped parent headers are reported. Example: `--add-header-redefinition-headers x-frame-options,content-security-policy`.

Config file example:
```
[add_header_redefinition]
headers = x-frame-options, content-security-policy
```
